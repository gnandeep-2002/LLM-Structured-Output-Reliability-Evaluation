# LLM-Structured-Output-Reliability-Evaluation
Comparative evaluation of LLM APIs (Gemini vs DeepSeek) in a deterministic 3D maze environment. Measures structured JSON compliance, navigation accuracy, and execution reliability under zero-retry constraints. Demonstrates LLM formatting discipline, spatial reasoning, and real-world action consistency.
